"""Holds the finalizing calls of docs/approval.md for an approver when the caller may not finalize them alone.

Sits next to the RBAC guard (same shape: path table, bearer lookup in a worker thread). The RBAC guard runs first, so a
caller without the base grant is refused there; this layer only ever sees callers who are allowed to *try*.
