"""How every ERP tool reaches business data — STEP 05.

A tool handler never imports a router function or a service and calls it
directly. Reason: several router functions in this codebase (e.g.
`commerce_customers.list_customers`) take `Query(...)` / `Depends(...)` as
their actual Python default values — those are FastAPI sentinels, only
unwrapped into real values by FastAPI's own request handling. Call such a
function directly with an argument omitted and you get the sentinel object
itself, not `None`; worse, a bare `Depends(require_permission(...))` used as
a default is inert outside of FastAPI's dependency injection — the
permission check inside it never runs. Reimplementing each tool against
router internals would mean re-deriving that specific pitfall correctly, for
every tool, forever.

Instead every tool calls the ERP's own public API over HTTP, forwarding the
*same bearer token* the end user's request carried. This makes the
non-negotiable rule in docs/AGAINERP_AI_OS_MASTER_PLAN.md §11 — "AI
permission can never exceed the calling user's permission" — true by
construction: the call is authenticated as that user, hits the exact same
`require_permission` dependency, the exact same tenant filter, the exact
same validation and serialization as if the user had called the endpoint
themselves. There is no second permission model to keep in sync.
