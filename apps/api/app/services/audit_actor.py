"""Stamp who made a change.

`deps.auth.get_current_user` puts the signed-in user on the request's database session (`session.info["actor"]`); this hook copies it
onto every catalog product that is created or changed in that session - the product form, the AI chat, the import, a bulk action.
A session with no actor (scripts, background jobs) leaves the columns as they are.
