"""Work out whether a returned unit is still under warranty.

Warranty is stored on the catalog product as free text ("1 year", "6 months",
"Lifetime", "Manufacturer warranty"), so this parses that text into a duration.
Anything it cannot read confidently comes back as `unknown` rather than a guess —
an agent then makes the call by hand, because a whole repair bill hangs on it.
