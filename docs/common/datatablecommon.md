# Common datatable standard

Every list page in AgainERP (Products, Brands, Categories, Payments, Cheque books, Customers …) follows this page. It is the **datatable half** of the common UI rules:

- global rules (day / night, square shapes, skeleton loading, one global pattern) — [ERP-UI-COMMON.md](../ERP-UI-COMMON.md)
- drawers (record forms and details) — [drawercommon.md](./drawercommon.md)
- **datatables (this page)** — the family, the shared shell, the look of a list page, what a cell may do
- which page / drawer uses which grid, and the table of behaviours every list shares (resize, zoom, filter menus, Filters / Columns / Live-edit drawers, Import / Export …) — [AGAIN-LIST-DATATABLE.md](../AGAIN-LIST-DATATABLE.md)

The **Products** list is the model: a new or redesigned list is built to look and work like it.

---

## 1. One family — the Again List Datatable

Admin lists that look like `/customers` (filter bar + AG Grid + zoom + 27 px native pager) are the **Again List Datatable** family.

- Shared CSS: `.ag-theme-again-list` / `.product-grid-fill` in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`.
- Shared pieces: `AgainListGrid` (`@/components/shared/again-list-grid`), `ListGridHeaderStart`, `GridZoomControl`, `GridFullscreen` / `GridFullscreenHeader`, `GridRefLink`, `RowActionsTrigger`, `GridChipBadge`, `FinanceAgListGrid` (`components/finance/finance-ag-list-grid.tsx`).
- **Do not invent a new list chrome.** Change `AgainListGrid` / `.ag-theme-again-list` so every list updates together. A grid file passes columns, rows, `filterBar`, `headerLeftActions` and its drawers as children — nothing else.
- **A new list adds a row to** [AGAIN-LIST-DATATABLE.md](../AGAIN-LIST-DATATABLE.md).

### Which wrapper

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| A finance-style list: column picker, CSV export, mobile rows, pinned actions column with the fullscreen toggle | `FinanceAgListGrid` (cheque books, cheques, accounts, journal …) |
| A catalogue-style list with live edit, bulk bar, drag to reorder, tree filter | `AgainListGrid` directly, as `product-grid.tsx` / `brand-grid.tsx` / `category-grid.tsx` do |
| Server-side paging (thousands of rows) | `AgainListGrid` with `serverPaging` — Customers is the reference |

---

## 2. Typography — one font, one size

- Every datatable uses Odoo's list font — **Inter** (`--font-list`) — at **one size** (`--ag-font-size`, 11 px at 100 % zoom, scaled by the zoom control). Header text matches cell size; headers are bold.
- It is enforced in `.ag-theme-again-list` (globals.css) for everything inside `.ag-cell` / `.ag-header-cell`, so a **column renderer must not set** its own `font-mono`, `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `font-size` or `font-family`.
- Need an id to stand out? Use weight (`font-medium`) or colour, never size or family. Icons (`.ag-icon`, `svg`) are exempt.

---

## 3. The look of a list page

Top to bottom, every list is:

```
[ Page name ] [ New ] [ ⚙ settings ] | search · filters …                                   (filter bar)
 ⚙ ⠿ ☐  Name        Slug     Products   Status      Updated    Updated by        ⚙         (pinned actions + columns)
 …rows…
 🔍 ─●─ 100 %   12 shown                          Page Size 50   1 to 50 of 410   ◀ 1 of 9 ▶   (footer)
```

### 3.1 Filter bar — page name first

- Every list's filter bar starts with a **page name**, left of `New` (or the other primary action), then the settings menu. Use `ListGridHeaderStart` (`@/components/shared/list-grid-header-start`) inside `headerLeftActions`.
- The label uses theme tokens (`text-foreground`) and square chrome; keep the title visible even when the user has no write permission.
- **Settings menu** (the `⚙` icon button, with a count badge of active filters): *Refresh · Filters · Columns · Export · Reset filters* (Products adds Import and Live edit). Filters / Columns open the list-settings drawers described in AGAIN-LIST-DATATABLE.md.

```tsx
import { ListGridHeaderStart } from "@/components/shared/list-grid-header-start";

const headerLeftActions = (
  <ListGridHeaderStart title="Cheque books">
    {canWrite ? (
      <Button size="sm" className="rounded-none" onClick={openCreate}>New</Button>
    ) : null}
    {/* ⚙ settings menu: Refresh, Filters, Columns, Export, Reset filters */}
  </ListGridHeaderStart>
);
```

### 3.2 The pinned actions column

- First column, **26 px wide, pinned left**, not resizable / movable (`product-grid-actions-col`). The header carries `GridFullscreenHeader` (expand the list to full screen).
- The cell is the **row menu**: `RowActionsTrigger` (the green **settings cog** icon, not a ≡ menu icon; the icon lives in `row-actions-icon.tsx`, so every grid that uses the trigger changes together) in a `DropdownMenu` — *View / Open · Activity · Edit · Delete*. Write actions only when the user can write.
- A click on the row itself opens the record's drawer (or the view sheet). A list with bulk actions adds a tick-box column, and a list the user may reorder adds the drag grip column, **after** the actions column.

### 3.3 Cells

- **Status** is a coloured, squared badge (`Badge` / `GridChipBadge`), never plain text: `success` = live / published / active, `warning` = draft / needs work, `outline` = parked (unlisted), `muted` = archived / closed. The badge sits in a `flex h-full items-center` wrapper so it is vertically centred.
- **Numbers** are right-aligned with `NUMERIC_CELL` / `NUMERIC_HEADER` (tabular figures). **Money** uses `formatMoney`; **dates** `formatDate`. Empty value = `—`.
- **Images** (logo, thumbnail) are a small square with `object-contain`; empty = a neutral placeholder square.
- **A value that belongs to another record is a link** — see §4.
- Columns that are rarely needed start **hidden** (`hide: true`) and are switched on from *Columns*; the choice is saved per user (`useUserScopedState`).
- A row that is not live (unlisted / draft / archived) is **dimmed** (`opacity-45`) so the live ones stand out.

### 3.4 Filters

- Dropdown filters use `FilterSelect` — down arrow on the left, the label, a cross on the right that clears it. `All statuses`, `All banks` … is the empty value.
- Search is one `Input` (`rounded-none`) that matches name, slug / number and the other text columns together.
- A **Clear** ghost button appears at the end while any filter is active. The count of active filters shows on the settings button.
- Filters can be hidden / shown per user from the *Filters* drawer (a list passes `filterToggles` or its own drawer).

### 3.5 Footer

- The 27 px native pager (page size, range, page buttons) is drawn by the shell. The zoom control sits at its left, and a list may add a short count next to it (`footerLeftActions`: "12 shown", totals).

### 3.6 Empty, loading, phone

- **Loading** — the shell's skeleton (`AgainListGridSkeleton`); never a blank grid or "Loading…" text. Keep it only for the first paint (`loading && rows.length === 0`); a refresh keeps the old rows on screen.
- **Empty** — a title that says why (*No cheque books yet* / *No cheque books match your filters*) and, when the list is simply empty, what to do next (*Click New cheque book to register the first one*).
- **Phone** — below the breakpoint the grid becomes cards / rows (`mobileLine`, or a `*MobileCards` component): title, one meta line, the key value. Tapping a card opens the same drawer.

---

## 4. A value that points at another record opens that record

On every admin datatable, a cell that **points at another record** (invoice #, order #, PO, receipt, customer, supplier, product, category, brand …) must be clickable and open that record's drawer. Do not leave those values as plain text.

Canonical cell: `GridRefLink` in `apps/web/src/components/shared/grid-ref-link.tsx`. Square, theme tokens, hover `text-primary`. Stop propagation so row-click actions (settle, row menu) do not fire.

```tsx
// ✅ GOOD — invoice / customer / supplier / PO
<GridRefLink title={row.invoice_number} onClick={() => openInvoice(row)}>
  {row.invoice_number}
</GridRefLink>

// ❌ BAD — related record shown but not openable
{row.customer_name}
```

- Document number → that document's form drawer (sales order, PO, receipt, RMA, …).
- Party name → customer (`AgainPartnerDrawer`) or supplier (`SupplierDetailDrawer`).
- Product / SKU on a list that has a product sheet → product drawer.
- No linked record → toast, do not navigate away.
- **Never put Next.js `<Link>` in grid cells.** Prefetch + row click abort the RSC payload (`TypeError: Failed to fetch` / `navigateToUnknownRoute`). Use `GridRefLink` or one `router.push`.
- Gated by the write permission where the drawer edits; works even when the column is live-edit enabled (single click on the value opens the drawer; the live editor needs a double click on the empty part of the cell).

Does **not** apply to status chips, dates or money columns. The full rule (live edit of a picked record uses the form's own picker, etc.) is in AGAIN-LIST-DATATABLE.md.

---

## 5. Day / night and square

- Datatables follow the global rules: theme tokens only, `useIsDark()` from `@/lib/use-is-dark` for AG Grid's theme class (`ag-theme-quartz-dark`), `rounded-none` on every badge, chip, button and tile.
- Checkboxes in cells and headers keep AG Grid's own checkbox glyph font — the `font-family` rule must not reach `.ag-checkbox-input-wrapper`.

---

## Recipe — a new list in ten minutes

```tsx
export const ChequeBookGrid = forwardRef<GridHandle, Props>(function ChequeBookGrid({ rows, loading, headerLeftActions, onOpen }, ref) {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState(DEFAULT_FILTERS);
  const filtered = useMemo(() => rows.filter(/* search + dropdown filters */), [rows, filters]);

  const columns = useMemo(() => [
    { colId: "number", field: "book_number", headerName: "Cheque book no", width: 150, cellClass: "font-medium" },
    { colId: "state", field: "state", headerName: "State", width: 110, cellRenderer: StateBadge },
    { colId: "created", field: "created_at", headerName: "Created", hide: true, valueFormatter: (p) => formatDate(p.value) },
  ], []);

  return (
    <FinanceAgListGrid
      gridRef={ref} storageKey="cheque-books" rows={filtered} columns={columns} loading={loading}
      headerLeftActions={headerLeftActions}          // <ListGridHeaderStart title="…"> New + ⚙ menu
      rowActions={(row) => <RowMenu row={row} />}     // RowActionsTrigger + DropdownMenu
      onRowClicked={onOpen}
      filterToggles={FILTER_TOGGLES} filterBar={(visible) => <>…search, FilterSelect, Clear…</>}
      emptyTitle="No cheque books yet" emptyHint="Click New cheque book to register the first one."
      csvFileName="cheque-books.csv" csvHeaders={[…]} csvRow={(r) => […]} mobileLine={(r) => ({ title, meta, value })}
    />
  );
});
```

The page wraps it with `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false, loading: <ListGridOpenFallback /> })`, owns the rows and the drawers, and passes the settings menu into `headerLeftActions` (it calls the grid's handle: `openFilters()`, `openColumns()`, `exportCsv()`, `resetFilters()`).

Reference implementations: `components/finance/cheque-book-grid.tsx` + `app/(admin)/finance/cheque-books/page.tsx` (finance wrapper), `components/brands/brand-grid.tsx` (catalogue list with live edit and bulk bar), `components/products/product-grid.tsx` (the model).
